# 🌍 Evolution 3D Simulator

Welcome to **Evolution 3D Simulator**, an interactive simulator where you can observe the evolution of organisms in a dynamic 3D environment. Configure your world, adjust creature parameters, and watch how they interact, reproduce, and survive through generations!

## 🎮 Main Features

- **Evolutionary Simulation**: Adjust the simulation parameters to see how different survival strategies influence evolution.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Terrain, resources, and environmental conditions impact the survival of organisms.
- **Diverse Behaviors**: Creatures can adopt different behaviors such as aggression, altruism, cooperation, or machine learning.
- **Real-time Graphs & Statistics**: Track population evolution, behaviors, and environmental conditions.
- **Persistent Simulations**: Save and load your simulations to explore different strategies.

## 🛠️ Customization

You can modify the simulation parameters through the user interface or directly in **codepen.js**.

### **Possible Modifications:**
- Adjust simulation speed
- Change world size
- Modify resource spawn rates
- Tweak organism behaviors

## 💡 How It Works?

Each organism has specific attributes and behaviors that influence its survival. Here are some examples:
- **Aggressive** 🟥: Attacks others to survive.
- **Altruistic** 🟦: Shares resources with others.
- **Cooperative** 🟩: Works in groups to maximize survival.
- **Tit-for-Tat** 🟧: Reacts based on others' actions.
- **Machine Learning** 🟣: Uses an AI algorithm to adapt to conditions.

The goal is to observe how these behaviors influence survival and reproduction over time.
